    This dashboard is designed to help students explore how dataset design influences the performance of retrieval models.

    Through this activity, students will:
    - Understand the evaluation metrics for retrieval models and use them to compare the performance of different models
    - Investigate how different dataset can affect retrieval accuracy
    - Design and evaluate their own retrieval datasets

    There won't be any coding involved. Students only need to create their datasets in excel forms and upload it here.

    _Will link to another introduction of retrieval models and sentence transformers_

    Students from Olin College of Engineering developed a note-taking application in summer 2025, EchoMinds, to support people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) with machine learning. App users could store information as notes and could later retrieve that information by asking questions. 
    The app implements a retrieval model that can match the user's question to the most relevant note instead of matching exact key words.    

    The retrieval system compares the meaning of a question with the meaning of every available note.
    For example, a user might ask:

    "What ingredients do I need for the pasta recipe?"
                
    A relevant note might contain:

    "Pasta: spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, cherry tomatoes, basil, parmesan cheese."
                
    Even though the question and note do not use exactly the same words, a retrieval model can recognize that they discuss the same topic.
    To do this, the model calculates a similarity score between the question and each available note. Notes with higher similarity scores are ranked closer to the top of the results.

    A strong retrieval model consistently places the correct note among its highest-ranked results, which can also be reflected by some metrics we'll discuss in the Evaluation Results tab.

    The SQuAD and Assistive Technology datasets were used by the Olin students and serve as examples of retrieval datasets.

# Upload Dataset
with tab3:

    st.markdown(f"""
    Before you start creating your own dataset and evaluating the model performance on it, you should make sure you've explored the Dataset Explorer Tab and have a sense of what a valid dataset looks like. We will also provide more examples below.

    #### Dataset Requirements

    Your dataset notes can be about any topic that could reasonably be stored in a note-taking application, including:

    - Cooking
    - Travel planning
    - Study notes
    - ......

    Your dataset must include 2 .csv files which you could create in Excel or Google Sheets and then export as .csv files. They are:

    1. context.csv
    This file contains your notes stored as sentences. Each row should contain one note. The first row should be a header row with the column name "Note". 
    Example:
    """)
    st.image("assets/contexts.png")

    st.markdown("""            
    2. qanda.csv
    This file contains questions and their correct matching note. Each row should contain one question and its corresponding note. The first row should be a header row with the column names "Question" and "Relevant Note". The "Relevant Note" column must contain the exact text of the matching note from context.csv.
    Example:
    """)
    st.image("assets/qanda.png") 

    st.markdown(f"""     
    #### Creating Your Dataset
    You can create the dataset yourself or use LLMs to help generate the dataset. Make sure the questions and notes are realistic and relevant to the topic. Here's a potential prompt you can follow:
    
    ```
    I'm building a test dataset for a note-taking app's search feature. Generate [NUMBER] short notes about [YOUR TOPIC]. Each note should be 1-3 sentences, written the way a real person would jot down a quick note for themselves.
    Then, choose [NUMBER] notes, write one question for each note that a person might ask later to look up that note. The question should NOT reuse too much exact same words as the note — it should ask about the same idea in different phrasing (e.g. if the note says "Pasta: spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, cherry tomatoes, basil, parmesan cheese," a good question would be "What ingredients do I need for the pasta recipe?" not "What are the pasta ingredients I listed?").
    
    Output the results as two lists:
    1. Notes (unnumbered)
    2. Questions and their corresponding notes in two columns (unnumbered, the notes must be exactly the same as in the first list)
    ```
                
    You are also encouraged to make both by yourself and by using LLMs and explore the differences in the evaluation results.

    **Recommended dataset size:** to keep things fast to evaluate and easy to review by hand, we recommend keeping your dataset under **{SOFT_LIMIT_CONTEXTS} notes** in context.csv and under **{SOFT_LIMIT_QANDA} questions** in qanda.csv. This is just a guideline, not a hard rule -- but datasets much larger than this may take a while to embed and evaluate.
                       
    #### Before You Upload
    - Every “Relevant Note” in qanda.csv must exist exactly in context.csv.
    - You can have multiple questions that match the same note.
    - You can have notes in context.csv that are not matched to any question in qanda.csv.                
    - You should manually check that the questions and correct notes pairs are accurate and make sense.

    After uploading, embeddings will be generated automatically and the dataset will become available for evaluation.

# Evaluation Results
with tab4:
    st.subheader("Evaluation Metrics")
    st.markdown("""
    This page summarizes how well different retrieval models perform on each dataset.
    The results table provides a quantitative comparison of retrieval performance across datasets and models.
    For information about the evaluation metrics used, please read this post: [Recall@k VS MRR](https://medium.com/@er111/recall-k-versus-mrr-918da3264f2a?sharedUserId=er111) 

    Choose which metrics to display below:

    - **Recall@1** measures how often the correct note is ranked first. For example, a Recall@1 score of 0.80 means the model returned the correct note as its top result for 80% of questions.
    - **Recall@3** measures how often the correct note appears within the top three results. This reflects how likely a user is to find the correct note after reviewing a small number of suggestions.
    - **Mean Rank** is the average position of the correct note in the ranked results (e.g., a Mean Rank of 2.5 means the correct note is typically found around the 2nd or 3rd spot). Lower is better.
    - **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)** evaluates not only whether the correct note was retrieved, but also how highly it was ranked. Models receive higher scores when the correct note appears closer to the top of the results list.
 
    A few other common retrieval metrics are **not** included above, because in this dataset every question has exactly one correct note. That single detail makes each of them turn into just another way of writing Recall@k or MRR, so they wouldn't tell us anything new:
 
    - **Precision@k** measures what fraction of the top-*k* retrieved results are actually relevant. Normally, if a question could have several correct notes, Precision@k and Recall@k would give different information. But here, since there's only ever one correct note, Precision@k is just Recall@k divided by k — it's the same score, only smaller and less intuitive. That's why it's left out.
    - **Hit Rate@k** measures whether *at least one* relevant result appears in the top-*k* (a yes/no per question, averaged across all questions). This distinction only matters when a question could have multiple correct notes. Since each question here has just one, "getting at least one hit" and "getting the one correct note" mean exactly the same thing — so Hit Rate@k is identical to Recall@k, just under a different name.
    - **Mean Average Precision (MAP)** averages precision at each rank where a relevant result appears, rewarding models that surface *multiple* relevant results early, then averages this across questions. It's built to reward finding several correct notes, in the right order. With only one correct note per question, that calculation simplifies down to exactly the same formula as MRR.

    #### The models being compared

    - **gemini-embedding-001** is Google's hosted embedding model, accessed through the Gemini API. It tends to capture nuanced meaning well but requires an internet connection and API calls for every embedding.
    - **all-mpnet-base-v2** is a general-purpose sentence-embedding model from the Sentence Transformers library, trained on a broad mix of text. It's the model EchoMinds itself uses.
    - **multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-dot-v1** is a smaller, faster Sentence Transformers model trained specifically for question-answering-style retrieval. It trades a bit of accuracy for much faster embedding speed.
